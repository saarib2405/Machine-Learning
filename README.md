## Dependencies
```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
```

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saarib2405/Machine-Learning.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ml-algorithms

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in its own Jupyter notebook. To use:
1. Open the desired notebook
2. Run the cells sequentially
3. Follow the documentation and comments within each notebook
4. Experiment with different datasets and parameters

## Dataset
The repository includes a `Datasets` folder containing various datasets used in the implementations. Each notebook specifies which dataset it uses and how to load it.
